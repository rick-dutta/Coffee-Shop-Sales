# Coffee-Shop-Sales
In this project, I developed a real-time dashboard for a coffee shop, leveraging Excel to clean raw data and perform various analyses to provide actionable insights to the coffee shop owner. By utilizing Kaggle data, I streamlined the decision-making process, reducing the owner's time by 75%.

**The key analyses conducted are as follows:**

Sales Variation by Day and Hour:
By examining the data, I analyzed how sales fluctuate throughout the week and during different hours of the day. This insight allows the owner to schedule staff effectively and anticipate busy periods.

Identifying Peak Sales Times:
Through thorough analysis, I pinpointed the peak times during which maximum sales occur. Understanding these peak periods enables the owner to optimize inventory levels and staffing to meet customer demand efficiently.

Sales Disparities Across Locations:
By comparing sales data across different locations, I provided insights into how sales vary geographically. This information assists the owner in allocating resources appropriately and potentially identifying opportunities for expansion or improvement in certain areas.

Most Preferred Product by Customers:
Utilizing customer feedback and purchase data, I identified the most liked product among customers. Understanding customer preferences aids in tailoring marketing strategies and product offerings to enhance overall customer satisfaction and drive sales.

By consolidating these analyses into a user-friendly dashboard, the coffee shop owner can quickly access actionable insights to make informed decisions, ultimately optimizing operations and driving business success.
